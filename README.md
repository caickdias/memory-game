# Memory-game with React Native and Expo

This is my very first React Native complete project.

It's a simple app where my main goal was to make a playable memory-game without following any tutorial (tried my own logic) and using stuff I learned from the past months that I've been studying Javascript.

There are some minor bugs and I don't have plans of fixing them as I'm moving to my next projects to keep learning RN.

Advices of how I can write my code any better is always welcomed!
