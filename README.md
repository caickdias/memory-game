# Memory-game with React Native and Expo

A simple app, but fully working memory-game written in React Native and using Expo platform. My first RN project.

# Getting started

## Dependencies

```
Windows 10
Expo version 6.0.2 (SDK 46)
Expo Go (phone app) version 2.25.1.1015582    
```

## Installing

Once you have everything installed and running, let's clone this repository and open its folder. No change to any files should be required.

```
git clone https://github.com/caickdias/memory-game.git
cd memory-game
```
Then run npm install to install dependencies

```
npm install
```

## Executing program

Simply start the server using the command below and then scan the QRCode showed in the console or find the server in the app to start the program.

```
npx expo start
```

## Help

You should be fine using 'expo start' to start the server

```
expo start
```

but it's recommended to use local CLI instead (recommended in SDK 46 or higher) with the command starting with 'npx'.

## Built with

[Expo](https://expo.dev/): Expo is an open-source platform for making universal native apps for Android, iOS, and the web with JavaScript and React.

[React Native](https://reactnative.dev/): React Native is an open-source JavaScript framework, designed for building apps on multiple platforms like iOS, Android, and also web applications, utilizing the very same code base.
